# Password Strength Evaluation

This project is part of a Cyber Security Internship task where we evaluate the strength of various passwords using the [Password Monster](https://www.passwordmonster.com/) tool.

## üîß Tool Used
**PasswordMonster.com** ‚Äî A free online password strength checker that estimates time to crack passwords based on character sets and length.

## üîç Evaluation Results

## üß† Key Learnings

- **Short passwords** and those with **simple patterns** (e.g., only numbers or lowercase letters) are extremely weak.
- **Mixing uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols** increases password strength significantly.
- **Length matters** ‚Äî longer passwords are harder to crack.
- Even common formats with multiple character sets (like "Hello@123") can still be weak if the length is low or the pattern is predictable.
- Strong passwords are those with **randomized character sets** and **long length** (10+ characters).

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Use at least **12 characters**.
- Combine **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.
- Avoid dictionary words or common patterns.
- Use a **password manager** to store complex passwords.
