# Password Strength Evaluation

This task is part of a Cyber Security Internship task where we evaluate the strength of various passwords using the [Password Monster](https://www.passwordmonster.com/) tool.

## üîß Tool Used
**PasswordMonster.com** ‚Äî A free online password strength checker that estimates time to crack passwords based on character sets and length.

## üîç Evaluation Results

## üîê Common Password Attacks

### 1. Brute Force Attack
- **Definition**: Tries every possible combination until the correct password is found.
- **Effective Against**: Short or simple passwords.
- **Example**: Trying `0000`, `0001`, ..., up to `9999`.
- **Prevention**:
  - Use long passwords (12+ characters).
  - Enable account lockout after failed attempts.

### 2. Dictionary Attack
- **Definition**: Uses a list of common passwords or words from the dictionary.
- **Effective Against**: Common or predictable passwords.
- **Example**: `password`, `admin123`, `qwerty`.
- **Prevention**:
  - Avoid real words, names, or known patterns.
  - Use a mix of random characters.

## üß† How Password Complexity Affects Security

- **Longer = Stronger**: More characters make brute force attacks take exponentially longer.
- **Character Variety**: Including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols increases the number of possible combinations.
- **Unpredictability Matters**: Avoid dictionary words and common substitutions like `P@ssw0rd`.

### Example:
- `123456` ‚Üí cracked instantly (very weak).
- `R@8k#Lm!4Tz` ‚Üí estimated 1 million years to crack (very strong).

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Use at least **12 characters**.
- Mix **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.
- Avoid using **real words** or **common patterns**.
- Store passwords in a **secure password manager**.
- Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** wherever available.
